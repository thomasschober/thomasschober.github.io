I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [New Zealand Policy Research Institute](https://nzpri.aut.ac.nz/) (formerly known as New Zealand Work Research Institute) at the Auckland University of Technology. Before joining the AUT in 2021, I worked for the Department of Economics at the Johannes Kepler University Linz. I study topics in health, family, and labour economics.
